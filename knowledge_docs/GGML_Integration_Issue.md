# GGML Integration Issue: whisper.cpp and llama.cpp

## Issue Description
When attempting to integrate both whisper.cpp and llama.cpp libraries in the same project, conflicts arise due to incompatible versions of the GGML library used by both projects. This issue manifests when trying to use both libraries simultaneously, particularly when loading models or running transformations like AudioToTextXForm or ImageToTextXForm.

## Root Cause
- whisper.cpp and llama.cpp both depend on GGML library but use different versions
- GGML API changes between versions are not backward compatible
- Both libraries statically link their own version of GGML
- When compiled together, symbol conflicts occur due to duplicate GGML implementations

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone both whisper.cpp and llama.cpp repositories
2. Attempt to compile them together in the same project
3. Try one of the following operations:
   - Load a whisper model and a llama model simultaneously
   - Run AudioToTextXForm using whisper.cpp
   - Run ImageToTextXForm using llama.cpp
4. Observe that one of the operations will fail due to GGML symbol conflicts

## Error Symptoms
- Linker errors during compilation due to duplicate GGML symbols
- Runtime crashes when loading models
- Inconsistent behavior when running transformations
- Memory corruption due to different GGML implementations trying to manage the same resources

## Technical Details
- whisper.cpp typically uses an older version of GGML
- llama.cpp uses a more recent version with significant API changes
- Key conflicting components:
  - Model loading functions
  - Memory management
  - Tensor operations
  - Context handling

## Current Workarounds
1. **Separate Processes**: Run whisper.cpp and llama.cpp in separate processes and communicate via IPC
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Load one library at a time, unload before loading the other
3. **Forked Versions**: Maintain a fork of one library with updated GGML version
4. **API Wrapper**: Create a wrapper layer that handles the GGML version differences

## Long-term Solutions
1. **Unified GGML**: Wait for both projects to converge on a common GGML version
2. **Namespace Separation**: Modify one or both libraries to use namespaced GGML implementations
3. **Dynamic Linking**: Convert both libraries to use dynamic linking for GGML
4. **API Abstraction**: Create a common abstraction layer that works with both GGML versions

## Impact
- Affects projects requiring both audio and text processing
- Limits the ability to use both libraries in the same application
- Increases complexity of deployment and maintenance
- May require significant refactoring to implement workarounds
