cuda is only supported on '(windows & x64 & !uwp & !xbox) | (linux & x64) | (linux & arm64)', which does not match x64-osx-release. This usually means that there are known build failures, or runtime problems, when building other platforms. To ignore this and attempt to build cuda anyway, rerun vcpkg with `--allow-unsupported`.
